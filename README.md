# Description
A personal portfolio website powered by [preact](https://preactjs.com/), a purified version of React, if you like.

You can visit the website at [https://arkadyt.com](https://arkadyt.com).

### Little Warning!
Styling classes of this project currently do not follow any of the adequate naming conventions. I recognize the mistake and a fix will be released in a very soon future!

In the meanwhile enjoy the website on any device, be that a desktop, a tablet or a mobile device! :)
