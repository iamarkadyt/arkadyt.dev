Tests:
    Use Enzyme serializer for snapshots. 
    It allows to serialize ShallowWrapper's ergo to use shallow rendering for snapshots.

    Projects.test.js has to be rewritten. I need to learn how to use React Router
    with shallow rendering. It doesn't render component passed to <Route/>.
    I will solve this jigsaw later, have to move on now, can't spend too much time on
    single things, project has to grow.
